# Trulle Mono

The monospace font **Trulle Mono** is a heavily customised derivate of another monospace font [**Iosevka**](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka).

While the font widths might constitute the most noticeable difference between the variants 9, 36, 74 and 76, they do possess other characteristics that can be distinguished by trying them at different fonts sizes and comparing their regular and italicised styles. Please, notice **Trulle Mono 9** in particular is supposed to be used at medium and large font sizes. Likewise, you might need to adjust the line height of your terminal manually if certain umlauts and accented characters like Å, É, À etc. don't show properly.
