# Trulle Mono Font Variants

This repository hosts the for the typeface Trulle Mono, a highly customizable monospaced font. This document describes three distinct variants of Trulle Mono: Trulle Mono Snake, Trulle Mono Slab and Trulle Mono Neue, highlighting their unique characteristics.

## Trulle Mono Snake

*Characteristics*:
Imagine a font that's a bit more artistic, with subtle curves and a flowing feel. It's not as rigid as some monospaced fonts.

*   **Who should use it:** If you fancy a softer, less aggressive look, or if you're using the font for creative writing, presentations, or anything where a touch of elegance is desired.
*   **Font Size/Resolution:** It should look good at most sizes, but its subtle curves might be less noticeable or even slightly blurry on very low-resolution screens or at extremely small font sizes. On high-resolution displays, its unique character will shine.
*   **For Coding?** Probably not the first choice for serious coding. The subtle curves might make it harder to distinguish characters quickly, especially when scanning lines of code.

## Trulle Mono Slab

*Characteristics*:
This one is bold and sturdy. Think of it as having little "feet" (serifs) on each letter, making them stand out more. It has a strong, almost typewriter-like presence.

*   **Who should use it:** Great for headings, titles, or any situation where you want the text to have a significant visual impact. It's very readable even at smaller sizes because of its clear, defined shapes.
*   **Font Size/Resolution:** Excellent across all resolutions and sizes. The strong serifs help maintain character distinction even on lower-resolution screens or when the font is very small.
*   **For Coding?** A solid choice for coding. The distinct serifs help differentiate similar-looking characters (like 'l', '1', 'I' or '0', 'O') which is crucial for code readability.

## Trulle Mono Neue

*Characteristics*:
This is the clean, modern, and straightforward option. It has no "feet" (sans-serif), giving it a minimalist and uncluttered appearance. It's designed for clarity.

*   **Who should use it:** If you prefer a sleek, contemporary look. It's particularly well-suited for user interfaces, digital documents, and especially for coding.
*   **Font Size/Resolution:** Performs very well at all sizes and resolutions. Its clean lines prevent blurriness on lower-resolution screens and offer crispness on high-resolution displays.
*   **For Coding?** Highly recommended for coding. The lack of serifs reduces visual noise, making it easy to read and scan code quickly. It's designed for long hours of screen reading.
