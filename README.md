# Trulle Mono

Three versions of the monospace font Trulle Mono are heavily customised derivates of Iosevka.

While the font widths constitute the most noticeable difference between the variants, they do possess other characteristics that can be distinguished by trying them at different fonts sizes and comparing their regular and italicised styles.
