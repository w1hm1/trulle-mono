# Trulle Mono

**Trulle Mono** is a heavily modified derivative of the monospace font [**Iosevka**](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka). Glyphs are radically different from its mainline variant and none of these variants in this project is as narrow as the font that this project has been built on.

This font has three variants:
- **Trulle Mono**:
  - A font that might work the best in an environment like IDE. It's not that thin but it still has more weight than two other variants in this project.
- **Trulle Mono Ext**:
  - This variant might be your cup of tea if you prefer bigger font sizes or/and if you dig the smoothness and roundness of the typical Swiss sans-serif fonts.
- **Trulle Mono Joke**:
  - For whatever reason, there are people who might consider the width of two other variants too narrow â€“ this variant might be suited for needs of those people. You can keep the font size of this variant relatively small without sacrificing the readability.
