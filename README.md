# Trulle Mono

**Trulle Mono** is a heavily modified derivative of the monospace font [**Iosevka**](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka). Glyphs are radically different from its mainline variant and none of these variants in this project is as narrow as the font that this project has been built on.

This font has three variants:
- **Trulle Mono Rich**:
  - The main font of the project. If you've been looking for a monospace font with some modern vibe i.e. the smoothness and roundness of the typical Swiss sans-serif fonts, this might be the answer. Check this one out at first and try others if this variation for whatever reason doesn't suit your needs.
- **Trulle Mono**:
  - This variation is supposed to work the best as the editor font in an IDE. It is not as heavy and narrow as the regular variant of the main Iosevka font but it still has more weight and less width than three other variants in this project.
- **Trulle Mono Ext**:
  - A variation of Trulle Mono Rich with more space between letters.
- **Trulle Mono Joke**:
  - For whatever reason, there are people who might consider the width of three other variants too narrow â€“ this variant might be suited for needs of those people.
