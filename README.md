# Trulle Mono

**Trulle Mono** is a heavily customised derivate of the monospace font [**Iosevka**](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka).

Certain umlauts and accented characters like Å, É, À etc. might not show properly in your terminal. In such a case, the line height of the terminal needs to be adjusted manually.

There used to be lots of variants in the repo but they had to be replaced with these two variants that work equally well anywhere.
