# Trulle Mono

Three versions of the monospace font Trulle Mono are heavily customised derivates of Iosevka.

While the font widths might constitute the most noticeable difference between the variants, they do possess other characteristics that can be distinguished by trying them at different fonts sizes and comparing their regular and italicised styles. Please, notice Trulle Mono 9 in particular is supposed to be used at medium and large font sizes. Likewise, you might need to adjust the line height of your terminal manually if certain umlauts and accented characters like Å, É, À etc. don't show properly.
